<h2>HTML</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
The HTML line break element can be used to display poems, song lyrics, or other forms of content in which the division of lines is significant.For example, say you writing a blog post about how to address an envelope or package. You want to include an example of how to format the sender and recipient addresses.
<img src="coding.jpg" width="100%">
</p><p style="margin-top:40px;">In that case, you could use the line break element to place the sender and recipient names, street addresses, and cities, states, and ZIP codes all on separate lines.Below you see the same address rendered in two different ways. The first uses one paragraph element and multiple line breaks. The second uses multiple paragraph elements and no line breaks. As a result, the margins are off.</P>
